## Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains implementations of the original 23 design patterns (as listed out in the Gang of Four book), in Java, as a sort of *aide memoire*. As such, the examples
are kept as simple as possible, and the ideas themselves are a mixture of orginal as well as from sundry sources.

### Creational

These are the patterns that are useful in creating new objects/entities. The advantage is that these patterns allow us to create objects without having to handle the concrete
classes or have intimate knowledge of implementation details ourselves, for the most part.

  * Abstract Factory [  ]
  * Builder [  ]
  * Factory [  ]
  * Prototype [ ]
  * Singleton [ ]

### Structural

Structural patterns concern themselves with class and object composition. Prodigious use of inheritance and aggregation is used in order to effect these patterns.

  * Adapter [ ]
  * Bridge [ ]
  * Composite [ ]
  * Decorator [ ]
  * Facade [ ]
  * Flyweight [ ]
  * Proxy [ ]

### Behavioural

Most behavioural patterns are about how communication occurs between objects.

  * Chain of Responsibility[ ]
  * Command [ ]
  * Interpreter [ ]
  * Iterator [ ]
  * Mediator [ ]
  * Mememto [ ]
  * Observer [ ]
  * State [ ]
  * Strategy[ ]
  * Template method[ ]
  * Visitor [ ]
